# SSStartup

## A startup for Someone & Sons projects.

SSStartup is a base of pattern library utilising atomic design principles and built on top of [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io).

It provides:

* A base of common atoms, molecules & organisms for [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io)
* A logical structure that allows usage of patterns directly as templates in [Craft](http://buildwithcraft.com)
* A base of common styles and logical structure based on [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org)
* A base of common behaviours and logical structure for Javascript built on [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* ... and more to come.
