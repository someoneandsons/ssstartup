# SSStartup

### A startup for Someone & Sons projects

SSStartup utilises atomic design principles to create templates that allows developers to use them directly in projects, but also acts as a stand-alone pattern library that is easily edited by designers and can be made accessible to clients.

It provides:

* Pre-configured project settings for [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) that compiles things to the right place
* A base of common atoms, molecules & organisms for [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io)
* A logical structure that allows usage of patterns directly as templates in [Craft](http://buildwithcraft.com)
* A base of common styles and logical structure based on [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org)
* A base of common behaviours and logical structure for Javascript built on [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* ... and more to come.

[Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com) can be used for creating data sets that act as placeholders for real content.
