<p>SSStartup utilises atomic design principles to create templates that allows developers to use them directly in projects, but also acts as a stand-alone pattern library that is easily edited by designers and can be made accessible to clients.</p>

<p>It provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-configured project settings for <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> that compiles things to the right place</li>
<li>A base of common atoms, molecules &amp; organisms for <a href="http://patternlab.io">Pattern Lab</a></li>
<li>A logical structure that allows usage of patterns directly as templates in <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com">Craft</a></li>
<li>A base of common styles and logical structure based on <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a></li>
<li>A base of common behaviours and logical structure for Javascript built on <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a></li>
<li>&#8230; and more to come.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.mockaroo.com">Mockaroo</a> can be used for creating data sets that act as placeholders for real content.</p>
